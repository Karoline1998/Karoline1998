### About me

Studying Systems Analysis and Development. :computer: :books:
With knowledge in programming languages â€‹â€‹such as C\C++, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, and persistence in databases such as PostgreSQL and others.
I gained practical knowledge of operating systems like Linux (and derivatives), and repositories like GitHub and GitLab.
I'm working on creating new ideas for applications, focusing on increasingly empowering myself in software development.
